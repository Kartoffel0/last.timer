# Original ReadMe

This is a pretty straightforward app that gathers your last.fm data based on the settings you choose then calculates the elapsed time that you spent listening to the music and orders your chart by that.
 
I am fine with anyone wanting to use the base code to create similar/improved applications, just drop me a message to let me know (email:p.mcdonough8133@gmail.com discord:IAmTheBlackMetal#1946 last.fm:https://www.last.fm/user/IAmThBlackMetal).
